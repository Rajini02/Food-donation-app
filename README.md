  In highly populated countries like India, food wastage is a disturbing issue. The streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel out so much food. Two-thirds of India’s population lives in poverty, unable to afford a single square meal per day. In the same country, however, restaurants end up with as much as 40% leftover food.
The irony cannot go unnoticed. With millions of hungry to feed, the gap b/w the needy and surplus must be bridged. Instead of wasting it we can donate it to various organizations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. Sattva does just that. It connects food donors to NGOs/charities within close proximity to provide the needy with food that would have otherwise gone to waste. NGOs and charities would be able to register on this app. When a restaurant, event organizer, or hotel wants to donate leftover food, they might look for organizations in the area that would be willing to collect food. Donors can then leave their contact/pick-up information in order for the organization to contact them. This would not only reduce food wastage but also fulfil many others’ needs.
