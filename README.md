# Food-donation-app
A Food donation app with built in google maps API
Introduction: 
In highly populated countries like India, food wastage is a disturbing issue. The streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel out so much food. Two-thirds of India’s population lives in poverty, unable to afford a single square meal per day. In the same country, however, restaurants end up with as much as 40% leftover food. The irony cannot go unnoticed. With millions of hungry to feed, the gap b/w the needy and surplus must be bridged. Instead of wasting it we can donate it to various organizations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. Sattva does just that. It connects food donors to NGOs/charities within close proximity to provide the needy with food that would have otherwise gone to waste. NGOs and charities would be able to register on this app. When a restaurant, event organizer, or hotel wants to donate leftover food, they might look for organizations in the area that would be willing to collect food. Donors can then leave their contact/pick-up information in order for the organization to contact them. This would not only reduce food wastage but also fulfil many others’ needs. 

Design Methodology: 

Software specifications:
The following software services are used in building this app: 
1.	FIREBASE - Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform that provides hosted backend services such as a real-time database, cloud storage, authentication, crash reporting, machine learning, remote configuration, and hosting for your static files. We’ll be making use of the authentication feature of Firebase. 
2.	GOOGLEAPI-Sattva uses the MAPS API from Google API package. As the app involves a volunteer going to a location specified by the donor, integrating maps into the app helps a lot. The API automatically handles access to Google Maps servers, data downloading, map display, and response to map gestures. 
3.	DATABASE STRUCTURE - We have created Two separate Databases for this application: 
A) To store donation information B) To store volunteer information 
4.	FIGMA: UI for this app was designed in Figma before implementation to make the app’s user experience smooth and sleek.
